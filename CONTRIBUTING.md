## Packages Releasing Difference

This project is managed by [changesets][], so packages releasing is controlled by [changesets][].

1. There will be a release PR generated by [changesets][]'s [action](https://github.com/changesets/action) automatically, when the release is ready, you should merge that PR firstly.
2. Then you'll need to pull the latest codes from remote.
3. Make sure you have both GitHub repository and npm write permissions at the same time.
4. You need a GitHub token with a `public_repo` scope as `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment to publish
5. Run `yarn release` simply, or `GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx yarn release` to export `GITHUB_TOKEN` at one time.
