## Packages Releasing Difference

This project is a [lerna][] monorepo, so packages releasing is controlled by [lerna][].

1. Make sure you have both GitHub repository and npm write permissions at the same time.
2. You need a GitHub token with a `public_repo` scope as `GH_TOKEN` in the environment to publish
3. Run `yarn release` simply, or `GH_TOKEN=xxx yarn release` to export `GH_TOKEN` at one time.
